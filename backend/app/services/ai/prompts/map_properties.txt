You are mapping user input data to Notion database properties.

RAW USER INPUT (exact text entered):
"{raw_input}"

CAPTURE DATETIME (Local Timezone - FOR REFERENCE ONLY):
- DateTime: {datetime_iso}
- Date: {date}
- Time: {time}
- Timezone: {timezone}
NOTE: This capture datetime is ONLY for properties explicitly about "when this was captured/added".

ANALYZED USER DATA:
{user_data_json}

DATABASE PROPERTIES TO FILL:
{properties_json}

INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH property, evaluate if ANY user data should fill it.
Consider:
- Property name meaning (e.g., "Raw Input" should get the exact user input)
- Property type compatibility
- Semantic matching

CRITICAL DATE RULES:
1. DO DATE properties ("do date", "date", "start date", "scheduled"): Use user_data["do_date"] if present
2. DEADLINE properties ("deadline", "due date", "due"): Use user_data["deadline"] if present  
3. CREATED DATE properties ("date added", "created"): May use capture datetime
4. DO NOT fill date properties unless explicitly provided in user data
5. DO NOT use capture datetime for do_date or deadline
