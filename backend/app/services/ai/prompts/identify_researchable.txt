Analyze which empty database properties could be researched and filled.

USER INPUT:
"{raw_input}"

CONTENT ANALYSIS:
- Title: {title}
- Type: {content_type}
- Detailed Analysis: {detailed_analysis}

EMPTY PROPERTIES (not yet filled):
{properties_json}

INSTRUCTIONS:
For each empty property, determine if it's "researchable" - meaning:
1. The property asks for factual information that can be looked up
2. Given the user's input (e.g., a movie title), this information could be researched
3. Examples: Director, Author, Year, Genre, Rating, Duration, Publisher, etc.

DO NOT mark as researchable:
- User-specific dates (deadline, do date, scheduled) - these require user input
- Personal preferences or ratings
- Subjective notes

RESPOND WITH JSON:
{{
    "researchable": [
        {{
            "property": "Property Name",
            "type": "property_type",
            "options": [...] or null,
            "reasoning": "why this can be researched"
        }}
    ],
    "not_researchable": [
        {{
            "property": "Property Name",
            "reasoning": "why this cannot be auto-filled"
        }}
    ]
}}

Return ONLY valid JSON.
